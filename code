# This program is used to find the Diameter, Circumference, Surface Area, and Volume of a sphere using a given radius. 
# The radius is user generated. The radius will be used in certain equations to calculate the correct output. 
import math
import fractions
# This is the variable for the fraction in the Volume equation
f1 = fractions.Fraction(4,3)
# This will be our starting point where we get the radius input from the user. 
# It will get a float value since it has a decimal.
radius = float(input("What is the radius of a sphere: "))
# This is where all the math will be complete and rounded to the 2 significatn digits after the decimal
diameter = round(2 * radius, 2)
circumference = round(diameter * math.pi, 2)
Surface_Area = round(4 * math.pi * radius * radius, 2)
Volume = round(f1 * math.pi * radius * radius * radius, 2)
# Output after the equations are complete
print("Diameter :", diameter)
print("Circumference :", circumference)
print("Surface Area :", Surface_Area)
print("Volume :", Volume)
